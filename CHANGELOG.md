## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-07

### Added
- **Embedded TypeScript Runner (`dist/runner`)**: Migrated provider runner to a self-contained, high-performance TypeScript process communicating with BB over IPC file descriptors and standard JSON-RPC wire protocol.
- **Native Event Streaming (`watchEvents`)**: Subscribed directly to `@earendil-works/pi-durable` native transactional event stream (`watchEvents`), streaming turn lifecycle, thinking deltas, tool executions, and progress events with sub-millisecond latency.
- **Model Discovery with `enabledModels` Scoping**: Implemented automatic resolution of Pi's `enabledModels` pattern whitelist (`resolveModelScopeWithDiagnostics`). Only explicitly enabled models are advertised to BB IDE, keeping model pickers clean and relevant.
- **Dynamic Context Estimation & `/compact`**: Integrated real-time token estimation (`estimateContextTokens`) from conversation history, emitting context window deltas directly to BB timeline. Added support for manual `/compact` commands.
- **Model-Aware Compaction Configuration**: Refactored harness setup to resolve model-specific compaction thresholds from Pi's `settings.json` (`modelOverrides`) via `settingsManager.getCompactionSettings(model)`.
- **Steer & Turn Lifecycle Discipline**: Aligned runner input submission with BB's `turn/steer` contract, emitting `input.accepted` with `providerTurnId` and properly reconciling pending steers.
- **Discovery Handler & Protocol Modularization**: Extracted dedicated `discovery-handler.ts`, `jsonrpc.ts`, and `bb-event-adapter.ts` to strictly adhere to architectural boundaries (AP-010, AP-019).
- **Master Parity Roadmap (Cycles 56–67)**: Published comprehensive 12-cycle architectural plan (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-07-arch-improvement-master-plan-pi-durable-parity.md`) for full engine parity and remediation.

### Fixed
- **Instant Per-Tool Output Completion**: Ensured individual tool completions emit immediately with aggregated output rather than stalling until turn completion.
- **Probe Mode Model Extraction**: Fixed model discovery in `--no-session` probe mode to reliably parse model catalogs from `raw.data.models`.
- **SQLite Directory Path Normalization**: Fixed handling of SQLite session directories and recursive cleanup on teardown.
- **Boundary & Error Types Discipline**: Replaced heuristic fallbacks with fail-fast typed contracts per AP-012 and AP-013.
